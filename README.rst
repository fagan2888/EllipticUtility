Computational files for paper, "Advantages of an Ellipse when Modeling Leisure Utility"
=================================

This repository contains the computational code used in the paper, "Advantages of an Ellipse when Modeling Leisure Utility," by Richard W. Evans and Kerk L. Phillips, *Computational Economics*, (forthcoming). We have included a PDF of the most recent draft of the paper, as well as Python code and Dynare code.

Python code
===========
The Python code for this paper is the file elliputil.py in the Python folder. All the analyses and Figures from the paper can be executed using elliputil.py, except for the real business cycle model from Section 3.3. This Python code is compatible with Python version 3.5+ and is not necessarily compatible with Python 2.x. We recommend the Anaconda distribution of Python from Continuum Analytics (download here, <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>). 

Dynare code
===========
The Dynare code for running the RBC model specifications in Section 3.3 of the paper is in the Dynare folder. Dynare is currently a toolbox that runs on top of the MATLAB computing platform. The user must have MATLAB to run this part of the code. You must also download the Dynare toolbox (download here, <http://www.dynare.org/download>).
